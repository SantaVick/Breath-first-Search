# Breath-first-Search

A clean, well-structured implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms on a directed graph in Java.

## Features

- Adjacency list representation using `List<List<Integer>>`
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) using Queue
- Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Clean object-oriented design
- Same graph used for both algorithms → easy to compare traversal orders
- Clear console output with proper formatting
